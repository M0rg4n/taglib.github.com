### TagLib 1.2 Release - July 7, 2004

*New Features:*

-   Add support for FLAC data in Ogg containers (“Ogg FLAC” files)
-   Added support for relative volume adjustment (RVA2) ID3v2 frames
-   Added support for attached picture (APIC) ID3v2 frames
-   Return a bool on File::save() to indicate success or failure
-   Implemented support for reading ID3v2 frame header flags
-   Return false from isValid() for FLAC files that are not parsed
    properly
-   Move the Vorbis classes into the Ogg namespace (binary and source
    compatibility preserved)
-   Added a convenience function fo accessing a list of ID3v2 frames of
    a certain ID using ID3v2::Tag::frameList(const ByteVector &frameID)
-   Add access to the ID3v1, ID3v2 and XiphComments of FLAC files to the
    public API
-   ByteVector optimizations to speed up copying
-   Add find() and erase() methods to Map
-   Added iterators and index operators to the string class
-   Plays nicely with ID3v2.4 tags generated by libid3tag

*Bugs Fixed:*

-   Do not append a XiphComment framing bit to XiphComments in FLAC
    files that have Xiph-style comments. Though required by the spec,
    this renders the files unplayable on some players
-   Fixed setting the language for ID3v2 comments to empty by default.
    This caused invalid comments to be written in the case that no
    comment previously existed
-   Fixed the spelling of “Psychedelic” in the ID3v1 genre list
-   The correct number of ID3v1 genres is 148, not 147. This caused
    Synthpop to not show up in the list
-   Fixed typo in the recording date frame ID – it was previously listed
    as “TRDC” where “TDRC” is the correct ID. TagLib seamlessly corrects
    this error on subsequent saves to affected tags
-   Fixed reading / parsing of ID3v2 genre tags as a null separated list
    rather than ID3v2.3-style ‘/’ separated lists with the ID3v1 genre
    in parenthesis
-   Properly handle extended header parsing, even if the extended header
    begins with null bytes. Previously this was being detected as
    padding
-   Fix a divide by zero that happened in the case of an MP3 file with a
    Xing header but no actual MPEG frames
-   Delete ID3 tags from memory (by default) when they’re stripped from
    files
