<h3>TagLib Audio Meta-Data Library</h3>
<p>
  TagLib is a library for reading and editing the meta-data of several
  popular audio formats.  Currently it supports both ID3v1 and
  <a href="http://www.id3.org">ID3v2</a> for MP3 files,
  <a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/">Ogg Vorbis</a> comments and
  ID3 tags and Vorbis comments in
  <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a>, MPC, Speex, WavPack
  TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4 and ASF files.
</p>

<p>
  TagLib is distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">GNU
  Lesser General Public License</a> (LGPL) and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">
  Mozilla Public License</a> (MPL).  Essentially that means that it may
  be used in proprietary applications, but if changes are made to TagLib they
  must be contributed back to the project.  Please review the licenses if you
  are considering using TagLib in your project.

<p>
  There is some general information about the motivation and workings of
  TagLib that can be found in the <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib/api/">API
  documentation</a>.

<h3>Goals and Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>TagLib is fast</strong> - tests have shown it to be about 6
  times faster than id3lib and 3 times faster than libvorbisfile at
  reading tags (CPU time)</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib is clean</strong> - TagLib is written in clean,
  object oriented C++ using a programming style common in KDE and
  Qt library programming</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib is easy</strong> - TagLib offers an abstraction layer
  that makes it easy to ignore the differences between the different
  file formats and their implementations</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib is powerful</strong> - for those that want to look
  under the hood TagLib provides access to the implementations of the
  individual file formats and provides a toolkit for doing advance
  manipulation of audio meta-data</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib is well documented</strong> - Every class, namespace,
  function and enumeration in TagLib is documented</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib supports Unicode</strong> - both ID3v2 and Ogg Vorbis
  standards are designed to support Unicode, so is TagLib (many tagging
  libraries and frontends are not)</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib is extensible</strong> - TagLib does not implement
  every feature of ID3v2, but does instead make it possible for
  application authors to extend TagLib to support the specific features
  that they need in their applications</li>
  <li><strong>TagLib is not toolkit specific</strong> - while TagLib does
  use KDE-style programming conventions and C++ by default, it does not
  link to either Qt or Glib (in fact it has <strong>no</strong>
  external dependancies) and does provide Glib-style C bindings
  (currently for the generic API only)</li>
</ul>
